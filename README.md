# Hyblab datasport 2016 - France 3

My participation to a inter-school contest, working with designers from the Ecole de design Nantes Atlantique. We worked with TV channel France 3 region.   
     
Our subject was the Vend√©e Globe, a french saling race doing a world turn. We choose to introduce the race by following each of its steps.  
Multi-media content includes : 3D objects, texts with tooltips, images, interractive data-visualizations and videos.  
   
Code can be pretty messy as we were very limited by time. By the way, we won the first place with it.
